						* SUMMARY *
						***********
Have you ever found yourself copying the same set of source files from project to project?

Perhaps you have copied your hash table to every project in which you would like to have a lookup table.

But then one day you find a bug in your helper file, and now you need to apply the fix in every projecty.

This library was created with this problem in mind.

It includes some helpful utilities such as a hash table and a linked list library.

Contributions are encouraged.

				    * USING THIS IN A CMAKE PROJECT *
				    *********************************
					
From the top level of your project, do "git clone git@github.com:max-ruttenberg/tools" and then

add this line to the top level CMakeLists.txt:

				add_subdirectory(tools)

If you have a CMakeLists.txt file in which you define a target that makes use of tools, add the

following lines:

			include_directories(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/include)
			link_directories(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/src)

And then for each target that requires tools, add the following two lines:

    	     	  	add_dependencies(<target> tools)
			target_link_libraries(<target> -ltools)
